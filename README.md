# OpenAgent Framework

OpenAgent is a framework for building AI agents capable of on-chain executions powered by Open. It equips AI agents with verifiable compute, enabling them to execute complex, intensive, or high-sensitivity operations with precision and reliability, such as defAI and deSci. Each compute is verifiable via Open Verifier with the proof-of-compute on the destination chain.

For more information, please visit the [OpenAgent docs](https://docs.open.network/guide/openstack/openagent).
